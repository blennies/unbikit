## Introduction

<Logo width="24" height="24" style="float: left; margin-right: 0.5rem;" /> unbikit (_un-bik-ɪt_) is
a decoder for `.bik` ([Bink Video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bink_Video)) files that can be
used to play or transcode videos. The format was first released in 1999 and has since been used in
many classic computer games.

This site hosts the documentation for the decoder, as well as a
⭐ [video player demo](/unbikit/demo) and other information.

There is also a [repository page on GitHub](https://github.com/blennies/unbikit)!

### Features

- Supports Bink 1, revisions `c` to `i` inclusive
- Handles demuxing and decompression of audio and video streams
- TypeScript/JavaScript (no WASM or native code)
- No dependencies
- Straightforward API: supply a video via `Blob`, `File`, `Request` or `URL`
  - the Web Streams API will be used where possible for efficient reading of video data
- Isomorphic
  - runs on client/server runtimes that support at least ES2022
  - can be run with older runtimes by using the syntax lowering feature of some bundlers
